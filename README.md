Developed a generic threadpool for efficient parallel processing.
Utilized synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes, to ensure seamless coordination among concurrently
running threads in the implementation of a parallel graph traversal algorithm.
Implemented functions such as task creation, task queue management and thread lifecycle control.
